MATLAB/C++ code for finding the solution diagram of the two-parametric max-flow problem [1].

Solution diagram of a random 25 variable problem.

Problem description
--
Given two parameters \lambda and \mu and n binary variables x_i the objective function to be minimized is

E(x) = \sum\_i (a\_i+b\_i\lambda + c\_i\mu)*x\_i + \sum\_( {i,j} \in N) x\_i(1-x\_j)d\_ij

where a,b,c,d are problem specific parameters restricted to be integers and N some neighborhood.
For fixed \mu and \lambda the optimal solution can be found efficiently via max-flow/min-cut.

Code
--
This code returns a solution diagram with the optimal solution given any choice of \lambda and \mu.

The algorithm works by intersecting tangent planes over and over again. 
This gives rise to numerical issues, to to tackle this the intersections are performed with exact arithmetic using the CGAL library [2].

Each max-flow problem is solved using [3].

The  tangent plane intersections in CGAL is rather slow making this code intractable for large problem.
